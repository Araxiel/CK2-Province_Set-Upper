Written for CK2 2.8.3.3 (SAHQ)
Tested with **CK2 2.8.3.3 (SAHQ)**

Using a comma-separated values table as a source, all necessary files and lines of codes are automatically create for all the provinces and baronies in the source file.

Written using [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

This is a super leightweight little tool I wrote for myself using Python. It's not fancy, but it get's the job done with incredible efficiency.

It's use lies somewhere between doing everything manually, and something like CK2's StoryGen.

Planned:
  * Random Dynasty generator
  * Random History generator
